# Encryption
Encryption is the process of encoding information. This process converts the original representation of the information, 
known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext. In here I'll be coding in Python the encrypting 
method Julius Cesar used in Rome.

I separated the code in 3 different codes, so for anyone who would like to recreate, can go step by step over the code. 

Enjoy your coding!
